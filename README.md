### What I tried

I am getting the error:

Failed to compile. TypeError: Property value of ObjectProperty expected node to be of a type ["Expression","PatternLike"] but instead got "JSXExpressionContainer"
src/pages/AboutPage/AboutPage.js

However, setting up for Netlify deploy and adding TailwindCSS Gradient and Hero Patterns dependencies does not trigger the babel errors I reported. Will keep working on what might be causing those...
